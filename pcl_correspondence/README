This directory provides an example for the non-ROS usage of PCL.
It's useful to check out newer features in PCL, that have been packaged yet 
or are not available in our ROS version at all.

=== How to use ===
1) Compile PCL by yourself. A tutorial can be found here:
  http://pointclouds.org/downloads/source.html
	Please note, that you should execute the cmake command with a
	directory prefix. You can then have a isolated PCL installation
	in your desired path, for example your home.
	Example compilation (when you are already in the PCL source dir):
	mkdir build
	cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/myuser/own_pcl/ .. 
	make
	make install # use 'sudo make install' if you chose a write-protected installation directory
2) Open the CMakeLists.txt in this folder and adjust the line that looks like this:
  set(PCL_DIR "/home/username/pcl-pcl-1.7.1/build/") 
	with your PCL directory. It's important that the path points to the build/
	directory in your PCL source folder.
3) Compile this project with:
  mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make
